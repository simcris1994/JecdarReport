\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The result of our work spanning two semesters, \jecdar, is an engine for modelling and verifying properties of real-time systems based on the specification theory of timed input/output automata defined in \textcite{David:2010}. Although there already exists an integrated environment that can do this, namely \ecdar, this tool requires a license for non-academic use. Our engine addresses this issue by being open-source and it is meant to be integrated with a GUI that allows efficient creation of models and verification of properties.

\jecdar is not a finished tool, as it lacks some of the features available in \ecdar, such as computing quotient, running models in a simulator and checking TCTL formulas. The aim of the project was to implement features that perform correctly, which meant that the goal of implementing as many features as possible was downgraded. Currently, \jecdar can be used to check features such as consistency, implementation and refinement and it can operate on the composition and conjunction of multiple transition systems.

The result of this process is not an engine that behaves exactly like \ecdar, meaning that there are several implementation differences between the two engines. A large part of our process consisted of discovering cases where \ecdar displays inconsistencies with the theory and devising ways to tackle said cases.

This report documented our initial goal for the project, observations regarding scenarios that display inconsistencies between \ecdar and the theory of timed input/output automata, concepts that we used for the purpose of correctly implementing certain features (both successful and unsuccessful), implementation details and a description of our testing approach.

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}
In this chapter we introduce some of prominent ideas for future work that can be conducted on \jecdar engine. Note that this chapter does not include the points from the future work described in our previous semester, which can be found in \textcite{Jecdar:2019}.

\subsection{Greatest fixpoint consistency}
Currently, \jecdar includes the least fixpoint consistency check as well as the full consistency check used in the implementation check. An interesting subject for future work can however be the computation of the greatest fixpoint consistency, described in Section \ref{sec:minConsistency}.

\subsection{Returning refinement relation}
\todo{recheck}
Even though this time the main focus was on refinement, there still exists one more possibility regarding it. Right now \jecdar is capable of returning the list of state pairs which participate in the refinement relation, however it is not being visually shown, so this gives us the future possibility of visually displaying the refinement relation.

\subsection{Support user-defined variables}
\ecdar 0.10 supports record variables, which are specified by the keyword $struct$, which follows the $C$ notation. An example of a record $k$ can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:struct}. Thus, user-defined variables can be a good candidate for new features in \jecdar.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Record example},label={lst:struct}, captionpos=b]
struct{
     int x;
     int y;
} k;         
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{TCTL formulas}
Since \ecdar 0.10 is built on top of \uppaal it includes TCTL formulas, which could be a subject for improvement in \jecdar. 

\subsection{State-space reduction techniques}
The field of model-checking is known for having the problem of exponential state-space growth during its exploration.
This can be another improvement that \jecdar can benefit from - the introduction of state-space reduction techniques. Some of such techniques can greatly reduce the amount of time and memory required during state-space exploration.

As already mentioned previously our focus is on correctness rather than performance. At the moment, \jecdar is making use of a rather primitive implementation of extrapolation abstraction. Hence, a very promising potential performance improvement could include implementation of more advanced extrapolation abstraction techniques, such as location-based bounds for extrapolation or lower and upper bound dependent extrapolation. For some models with very big values of the time-progress conditions (guards and invariants) this could greatly reduce the size of the state-space that has to be explored.

Another case of abstraction could be the symmetry reduction. It is based on the \textit{state swaps} that are used to reduce the size of the state-space that has to be explored, consequently reducing time and memory needed for verification. According to \textcite{SymmetryReduction}, to achieve that a suitable bisimulation equivalence has to be derived from the system description, introducing the necessity for the engine to support such declarations. Afterwards, the representative function is constructed and used to convert a state into a corresponding equivalence class. Then when doing a reachability analysis it suffices to explore and store only one representative of equivalence class.
