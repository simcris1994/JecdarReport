abstract="We present a real-time specification framework based on Timed I/O Automata and a comprehensive tool support for it. The framework supports various design methodologies including: top-down refinement---for decomposition of abstract specifications towards increasingly detailed models; bottom-up abstraction---for synthesis of complex systems from more concrete models; and step-wise modularisation of requirements---to factor out behaviours given by existing available components from a complex global requirements specification to be implemented. These methodologies are realized by consecutive applications of operators from the following set: refinement, consistency checking, logical and structural composition and quotienting. Additionally, our tool allows combining the component-oriented design process with verification of temporal logic properties increasing the flexibility of the process.",

abstract="Timed automata have an infinite semantics. For verification purposes, one usually uses zone-based abstractions w.r.t. the maximal constants to which clocks of the timed automaton are compared. We show that by distinguishing maximal lower and upper bounds, significantly coarser abstractions can be obtained. We show soundness and completeness of the new abstractions w.r.t. reachability and demonstrate how information about lower and upper bounds can be used to optimise the algorithm for bringing a difference bound matrix into normal form. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that the new techniques dramatically increase the scalability of the real-time model checker UPPAAL.",

We propose a locationbased finite zone abstraction, which computes an abstraction based on the relevant guards for a particular state of the model (as opposed to all guards).We show that the location-based zone abstraction is sound and complete with respect to location reachability; that it generalises active-clock reduction, in the sense that an inactive clock has no relevant guards at all; that it enlarges the class of timed automata, that can be verified. We generalise the new abstraction to the case of networks of timed automata, and experimentally demonstrate a potentially exponential speedup compared to the usual abstraction.",

abstract="We present Ecdar a new tool for compositional design and verification of real time systems. In Ecdar, a component interface describes both the behaviour of the component and the component's assumptions about the environment. The tool supports the important operations of a good compositional reasoning theory: composition, conjunction, quotient, consistency/satisfaction checking, and refinement. The operators can be used to combine basic models into larger specifications to construct comprehensive system descriptions from basic requirements. Algorithms to perform these operations have been based on a game theoretical setting that permits, for example, to capture the real-time constraints on communication events between components. The compositional approach allows for scalability in the verification.",

abstract="We describe a prototype extension of the real-time model checking tool Uppaal  with symmetry reduction. The symmetric data type scalarset, which is also used in the Murϕ model checker, was added to Uppaal's system description language to support the easy static detection of symmetries. Our prototype tool uses state swaps, described and proven sound earlier by Hendriks, to reduce the space and memory consumption of Uppaal. Moreover, the reduction strategy is canonical, which means that the symmetries are optimally used. For all examples that we experimented with (both academic toy examples and industrial cases), we obtained a drastic reduction of both computation time and memory usage, exponential in the size of the scalar sets used.",
